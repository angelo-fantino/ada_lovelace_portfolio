          <p>
            Hi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician
            and writer, chiefly known for my work on Charles Babbage's proposed
            mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications
            beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm
            intended to be carried out by such a machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I like to read about scientific developments,
            mathematics, and computational mathematics. I also like to take my
            chances of winning big.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fun fact! I've been programing for
            <span id="dateOfBirth"></span> seconds!

          <h3>A Summary About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815
            – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly
            known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical
            general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first
            to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure
            calculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ada Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and
            reformer Lady Byron.[2] All Lovelace's half-siblings, Lord Byron's
            other children, were born out of wedlock to other women.[3] Byron
            separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England
            forever. He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother remained
            bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an
            effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived
            insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her
            two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to
            him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued
            her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was
            made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of
            Lovelace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with
            scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David
            Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the author
            Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education.
            Ada described her approach as "poetical science"[4] and herself as
            an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".[5]
          </p>
          <p>
            When she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long
            working relationship and friendship with fellow British
            mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of
            computers". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on
            the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through
            their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by the military
            engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the
            Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of seven
            notes, simply called "Notes".
          </p>
          <p>
            Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers,
            especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be
            the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be
            carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective
            and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837
            contain the first programs for the engine.[6][better source needed]
            She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go
            beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others,
            including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[7]
            Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the
            Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals
            and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.[3]
